## about

You are a member of the hardy but technologically primitive Clickonian
people. The other Clickonians generally defer to you when it comes to making
important decisions. It is your task to shepherd your people through the
Stone Age into a brighter, more prosperous future.

The tribe must develop various technologies and cultural achievements
to stand any hope of surviving more than a few years.
